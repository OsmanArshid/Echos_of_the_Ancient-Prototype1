# **Echoes of the Ancients: Prototype 1**

## **Introduction**
Welcome to **Echoes of the Ancients**, a third-person adventure game where players step into the world of Ashkan, a determined protagonist, exploring an expansive terrain filled with enemies.

## **Ashkan's Backstory**
Ashkan is no ordinary explorer—his journey is one of redemption and revelation. Hailing from a once-proud tribe of mystics and warriors, Ashkan is a lone survivor of a catastrophic betrayal that erased his people from existence. Haunted by memories of his past and fueled by whispers of an ancient power hidden in the ruins of his homeland, Ashkan is on a quest to uncover the truth behind his tribe's downfall. 

Wielding courage and determination, Ashkan’s journey is not just about survival but about reclaiming his heritage and fulfilling the prophecy that foretold the rise of the **Ancients' Echoes**.

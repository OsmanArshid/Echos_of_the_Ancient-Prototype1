# **Echoes of the Ancients: Prototype 1**

## **Introduction**
Welcome to **Echoes of the Ancients**, a third-person adventure game where players step into the world of Ashkan, a determined protagonist, exploring an expansive terrain filled with enemies. This prototype represents the initial foundation of the game, featuring navigable terrain, idle enemies, and free movement for Ashkan within the world.

---

## **About the Project**
In this prototype, you will:
- Explore a detailed **terrain** crafted to provide a realistic and immersive environment. But initially, there is only one (1) level.
- Take control of **Ashkan**, the main character, with initial animation movement and move freely across the game world.
- Encounter **enemies**, which are currently inactive placeholders for future AI development.
- A lot of limitations and unoptimized implementation - as we are learning right now.

## **Controls**
### Movement Keys:
1. Arrow keys for movement around the Terrain (up/down/left/right).
2. "X" key for attacking animation.
3. "Q" key for dashing/rolling ahead 

---

## **How to Play**
1. Open the project in Unity or run the built executable.
2. Control **Ashkan** to explore the terrain and navigate freely across the world.
3. Observe and take note of the enemy placements as placeholders for upcoming mechanics.

## **Planned Features**
While this prototype lays the groundwork, future iterations of **Echoes of the Ancients** aim to include:
- **Enemy AI**: Dynamic interactions with AI implementation of enemies, including combat mechanics.
- **Story Elements**: Cutscenes and in-game lore to expand on Ashkanâ€™s journey.
- **Enhanced Terrain**: Additional biomes, structures, and environmental storytelling with **MORE** levels.
